BoxyHQ helps developers automate product security and provides low-code APIs to enable enterprise-compliant security via simple and efficient integrations. This includes SAML SSO, audit logs, directory sync and privacy vault.

Through its commercial open source shift left approach, it intends to become the leading Developer Security platform; think of it as an extension of your security team if you don't have one.

## SAML Jackson
To add SAML single sign-on authentication to your product check out our [Github repo](https://github.com/boxyhq/jackson)

## Directory Sync

## Audit Logs
To add Audit Logs to your SaaS or OSS product check out our [Github repo](https://github.com/retracedhq/retraced). We are collaborating with our friends at [Replicated](https://replicated.com/) to bring you a fully open-source audit log service and embeddable UI that's easily deployed to an infrastructure of your choice.

## Awesome developer security tools
We have curated a list of [awesome open-source developer security tools](https://github.com/boxyhq/awesome-oss-devsec). It includes security principles and controls relevant to popular compliance certifications (like ISO27001, SOC2, MVSP, etc.).

## Coming Soon
Privacy Vault product is coming soon. We are also in the very early stages of building Developer Security Mesh (DevSecMesh) to automate security across your entire tech stack. Please get in touch (details below) if you'd be interested to test these in private beta in the meantime.
